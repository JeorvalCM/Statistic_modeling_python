    "## Problem 2 - Classifying temperatures (**8 points**)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is meant to introduce you to a very commonly used and useful concept of data classification.\n",
    "In this problem your aim is to classify daily temperatures stored in `temperatures` list into four different classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Cold** ==> temperatures below -2 degrees (Celsius)\n",
    "  2. **Slippery** ==> temperatures warmer or equal to -2 degrees and up to +2 degrees (Celsius)\n",
    "  3. **Comfortable** ==> temperatures warmer or equal to +2 degrees and up to +15 degrees (Celsius)\n",
    "  4. **Warm** ==> temperatures warmer or equal to +15 degrees (Celsius)\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, you should modify and fill in the missing parts in the following cells.\n",
    "In total, there are three tasks that you should solve according the directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notice**: follow closely the instructions, e.g. using **exactly** the same variable names as mentioned in the instructions because your answers will be automatically graded, and the tests that grade your answers rely on following the same formatting as in the instructions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your score on this problem will be based on following criteria:**\n",
    "\n",
    " - Using for loop to iterate over the temperature values\n",
    " - Using conditional statements to find out if a value is within certain value range\n",
    " - Printing information for the user\n",
    " - Including comments that explain what most lines in the code do"
